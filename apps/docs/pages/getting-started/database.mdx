# Database Configuration

This document outlines the steps for configuring the PostgreSQL database for the Buildog project. We assume that PostgreSQL is already installed on your system.

- PostgreSQL is installed and running on 5432 port. (default)

## Configuration Steps

### Create a New User

First, we need to create a new PostgreSQL user. Execute the following SQL command in the PostgreSQL command line interface (psql):

```sql
CREATE USER buildog WITH PASSWORD 'your-beautiful-password';
```

### Create a New Database

Next, create a new database named buildog:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE buildog;
```

### Grant Privileges to the User

Grant the newly created user the necessary privileges on the buildog database:
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE buildog TO buildog;
```

### Update Project Code

You need to update an '.env' file for our backend application under **apps/api**. `your-beautiful-password` needs to be hear.

```env
/* ... other keys */
DB_PASSWORD=your-beautiful-password
```


Navigate to the apps/api/scripts directory in your project using the terminal. This scripts folder contains a setup-db.sh script for creating tables. The chmod +x command is used to make the script executable. Once the script is executable, you can run it directly.
```
chmod +x setup-db.sh
./setup-db.sh
```

Your PostgreSQL database is now configured and ready for the Buildog project. You have created the necessary user, database, and tables, and updated your project code to handle table creation.
