# Database Configuration

This document outlines the steps for configuring the PostgreSQL database for the Buildog project. We assume that PostgreSQL is already installed on your system.

- PostgreSQL is installed and running on 5432 port. (default)

## Configuration Steps

### Create a New User

First, we need to create a new PostgreSQL user. Execute the following SQL command in the PostgreSQL command line interface (psql):

```sql
CREATE USER buildog WITH PASSWORD 'your-beautiful-password';
```

### Create a New Database

Next, create a new database named buildog:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE buildog;
```

### Grant Privileges to the User

Grant the newly created user the necessary privileges on the buildog database:
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE buildog TO buildog;
```

### Update Project Code

You need to update an '.env' file for our backend application under **apps/api**. `your-beautiful-password` needs to be hear.

```env
/* ... other keys */
DB_PASSWORD=your-beautiful-password
```


Navigate to the apps/api/scripts directory in your project using the terminal. This scripts folder contains a setup-db.sh script for creating tables. The chmod +x command is used to make the script executable. Once the script is executable, you can run it directly.
```
chmod +x setup_db.sh
./setup_db.sh
```

Your PostgreSQL database is now configured and ready for the Buildog project. You have created the necessary user, database, and tables, and updated your project code to handle table creation.

## Multi-Tenant Blog Platform Database Design

This database design outlines the structure for a multi-tenant blog platform. The design includes tables for organizations, users, organization-user relationships, and blogs, with appropriate columns and constraints. The design aims to support multiple organizations, each with its own users and blogs.

### Organizations

Represents a collection of users and blogs, essentially acting as a tenant in the multi-tenant system.

| Column      | Data Type      | Constraints                     | Description                                         |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| id          | SERIAL         | PRIMARY KEY                     | Unique identifier for the organization.             |
| name        | VARCHAR(255)   | NOT NULL, UNIQUE                | Unique name of the organization.                           |
| created_at  | TIMESTAMP      | NOT NULL, DEFAULT NOW()         | Timestamp of when the organization was created.     |
| updated_at  | TIMESTAMP      | NOT NULL, DEFAULT NOW()         | Timestamp of the last update to the organization.   |


### Users

Represents individuals who can belong to one or more organizations.

| Column        | Data Type      | Constraints                     | Description                                         |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| id            | VARCHAR(128)   | PRIMARY KEY                     | Unique identifier for the user.                     |
| first_name    | VARCHAR(255)   | NOT NULL                        | First name for the user                             |
| last_name     | VARCHAR(255)   | NOT NULL                        | Last name for the user                              |
| email         | VARCHAR(255)   | NOT NULL, UNIQUE                | Unique email for the user                           |
| created_at    | TIMESTAMP      | NOT NULL, DEFAULT NOW()         | Timestamp of when the user was created.             |
| updated_at    | TIMESTAMP      | NOT NULL, DEFAULT NOW()         | Timestamp of the last update to the user.           |

### Organization Users

A join table that associates users with organizations, including their role within the organization.

| Column            | Data Type      | Constraints                                                | Description                                                            |

| user_id           | VARCHAR(128)   | FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE         | Identifier for the associated user.                                    |
| role              | VARCHAR(50)    | NOT NULL                                                   | Role of the user within the organization (e.g., admin, member).        |
| created_at        | TIMESTAMP      | NOT NULL, DEFAULT NOW()                                    | Timestamp of when the association was created.                         |
| updated_at        | TIMESTAMP      | NOT NULL, DEFAULT NOW()                                    | Timestamp of the last update to the association.                       |
| PRIMARY KEY       |                | (organization_id, user_id)                                 | Composite primary key to ensure unique user-organization associations. |

### Blogs

| title            | VARCHAR(255)   | NOT NULL                                                   | Title of the blog post.                                    |

This design ensures proper isolation and management of data across multiple organizations, supporting role-based access control and efficient management of blog content. The schema can be further extended or customized based on specific application requirements.
