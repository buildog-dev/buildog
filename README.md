### Install dependencies

You will need to install and configure the following dependencies on your machine to build Buildog:

- Git
- Node.js v18.x (LTS)
- pnpm version 8.x.x

## Local development

This repo uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo).

### Fork the repo

To contribute code to Buildog, you must fork the [Buildog](https://github.com/burasibizim/buildog) repo.

### Clone the repo

1. Clone your GitHub forked repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<github_username>/buildog.git
```

2. Go to the Buildog directory:

```sh
cd buildog
```

### Install dependencies

1. Install the dependencies in the root of the repo.

```sh
pnpm install # install dependencies
```

2. After that you can run the apps simultaneously with the following.

```sh
pnpm dev
```

| Directory       | Description                   | Local development server |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `/apps/buildog` | The main web application.     | http://localhost:3000    |
| `/apps/api`     | The main backend application. | http://localhost:3010    |
| `/apps/docs`    | The main documentation.       | http://localhost:8080    |

#### Environment variables

Environment variables documentation includes instructions on how to set up Firebase and the database for Buildog. Providing [environment variables documentation](https://docs.buildog.dev/getting-started/environment-variables/) is highly recommended to getting started.
Firebase - [How to setup Firebase](https://docs.buildog.dev/getting-started/authentication/)
Database - [How to setup Database](https://docs.buildog.dev/getting-started/database/)

#### Shared components

The monorepo has a set of shared components under /packages:

- `/packages/ui`: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) components.
- `/packages/typescript-config`: Shared Typescript settings
- `/packages/eslint-config`: Shared eslint settings

#### Adding new component on @repo/ui

Use the pre-made script:

```sh
pnpm ui:add <shadcn/ui-component-name>
```

> This works just like the add command in the `shadcn/ui` CLI.

#### Installing packages

Installing a package with pnpm workspaces requires you to add the `--filter` flag to tell pnpm which workspace you want to install into. Do not install dependencies in their local folder, install them from the route using the --filter flag.

```sh
pnpm add <package> --filter <workspace>
pnpm uninstall <package> --filter <workspace>
```

For example:

- `pnpm add react --filter ./apps/buildog` installs into ./apps/buildog
